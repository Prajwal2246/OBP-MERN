        <h2>College Life</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>Newfound Freedom & Responsibility</h3>
          You manage your own schedule, choices, and time ‚Äî but that freedom comes with the need for self-discipline.
         <h3>üìö Academic Pressure & Learning Curve</h3>
          College studies are deeper and more independent than school; you need to develop critical thinking, not just memorization.
         <br>
         <h3>ü§ù Friendships & Social Life</h3>
         You meet diverse people, form strong bonds, and create lifelong memories through hostels, clubs, events, and group work.
         <h3>üí∏ Budgeting & Adulting Skills</h3>
         Managing money, food, laundry, and sometimes even part-time jobs ‚Äî it's a big step toward adult life.
         <h3>üå± Personal Growth & Self-Discovery</h3>
         You start figuring out who you are, what you value, and where you want to go in life ‚Äî emotionally, academically, and professionally.
