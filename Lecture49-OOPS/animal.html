        /* Prototype chaining
         ->if  an instance doesnot find an method so it searches in its parent's prototype
         -> if not in its parent's prototype then it searches in it's parent's parent prototype.

         //when an child class calls super then 
         -> it calls parent class constructor
         -> that parent's constructor sets all the properties 
         -> when parent is constructing properties then all things are saved in "this" keyword .

         //parent does 
         -> sets all properties in "this" and the "this" is of children  class

         encapsulatuion (methods+props)
           -> sensitive data are protected (private krte data ko )
           -> getters and setter we can access

         inheritance 
           -> super keyword ,extend keyword 
           -> common parent class and child inherits
           -> (is a) relationship 
           ex-> car is a vehicle,truck is a vehicle
           ex-> dog is a animal,cat is  a animal

         polymorphism -(many forms)
           -> dog also speak , cat can speak 
           but dog speak is bhow bhow , cat speak is meow  meow
           so the speak is here polymorphism
           -> differnt classes can implement methods of same name (above ex-> speak)
         
         abstraction
          -> hiding unncessary data and showing only what needs to show
          -> hidding implementation (protect business logic)

         composition
          -> (has a) realtionship
          -> ex-> profile has a settings page
                  profile has a accounts page
          -> ex-> profile page kholte hi muze setting aur accounts load hona chahiye uske liye profile ke constructor me apn dono ke instance banake "this" se attach krenge
